## Course Goals
Students will gain familiarity with current universal gate quantum computing tools and technology. Students will also become comfortable with several QC algorithms and their implentation on state of the art quantum computer simulators and hardware. 

## Grading
40% Homeworks, 30% group project, 30% weekly quizzes.

## Homeworks
4 homeworks that are worth 10% each that will be evenly distributed throughout the semester.

## Group Project
A group project taking up much of the semester will be required. Teams will choose their own project topic. Suggested projects will be supplied.

## Quizzes
Each week a quiz will be given. Only the top 12 of 14 quizzes will count.


Note: The syllabus is subject to occasional change. This is especially the case in the latter half of the semester once your professors have become comfortable with the group's overall skill level. Adequate notice will be given.
