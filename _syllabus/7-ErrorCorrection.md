### Before Class
Read Moinuddin K Qureshi work (To be suggested by Qureshi)

### Summary
Quantum bits are unreliable and require error correction. Classical bits require error correction too, but not on this level. Lets explore what makes creating a good quantum computer so daunting. We will also look at some basical error correction strategies that can help you out on smaller circuits that you are currently running.


### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
