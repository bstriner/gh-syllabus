### Before Class
Read Chapters 4-5 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book
(Read some explanation of CHSH)

### Summary
We will go over teleporting a quantum state from one qubit to another. This will require knowledge of the No Cloning Theorem, No Signalling Theorem and Entanglement. We will also go over one of Bell's famous theorems and an implementation of it: CHSH

Next we will go over the implementation of basic math on quantum computers.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
- Given time, chapter 4 will be covered on Monday and Chapter 5 on Wednesday
