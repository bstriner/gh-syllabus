## Assignment Due
- Create a map or other spatial resource and be prepared to present it briefly in class, if requested. If you created or updated data for the map, make sure you've committed it and pushed it to github in the manner described for last week's assignment. If your map is a live resource on the web somewhere, add link(s) to it to the week doc along with your reading responses; if static file(s), either commit and push these to your github repository or upload them to your Omeka site and put the link(s) in the weekly doc.
