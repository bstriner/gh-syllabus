## Assignment Due
- Continue in the Python course until you feel comfortable adapting one of its algorithms to a text of your choosing.

## Before Class

### Download/Install/Etc.
- Install Omeka via Reclaim Hosting. Info [here](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/installing-omeka-on-reclaim-hosting/193).

## For Class

- Read Scheinfeldt, T. 2010. "Omeka and Its Peers". [Link](http://omeka.org/blog/2010/09/21/omeka-and-peers/)
- Read (or re-read as necessary) the documentation for Reclaim Hosting (“Getting Started,” “Domain Management,” and “Omeka”)
- Study two metadata schemes:
    - Dublin Core metadata scheme (some help with the categories): [http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core](http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core)
    - And one other from this list, one that corresponds to the kind of objects you work with: [http://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-metadata-and-data-management/metadata-standards/](http://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-metadata-and-data-management/metadata-standards/)
- Check out at least two sites that use Omeka and review their organization and the metadata categories they use: 
    - http://omeka.org/codex/How_Might_You_Use_Omeka
    - https://omeka.org/codex/Sites_Using_Omeka
        - Here is one that deals with Classics: http://bosher.northwestern.edu/
    - One recent pilot ISAW Omeka collection set up by Patrick Burns: Digital Central Asian Archaeology: http://dcaa.hosting.nyu.edu/. (Hopefully, we will have a new link up soon...)
- On the Week 4 Google Doc:	
    - Tell us which schema besides Dublin Core you looked at and why
    - Briefly review the Omeka sites with respect to organization and metadata choices or schemata
    - List 8 objects you might want to organize in something like Omeka for research, presentation, or teaching and think about what metadata categories you might want to use to describe them.
