## Assignment Due
- Create an Omeka site via NYU's Reclaim Hosting pilot (http://hosting.nyu.edu). For this exercise, please concentrate on functionality over aesthetics of presentation. Your site must have at least 12 objects in at least two different collections and a clear rationale for the metadata categories (you will want to modify the default Dublin Core) and controlled vocabularies you use. Please also install two plugins.
