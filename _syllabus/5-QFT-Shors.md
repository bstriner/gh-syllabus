title: QFT and Shor's Algorithm
tags: [FFTisSlow, DownWithRSA]

### Before Class
Read Chapters 6 & 10 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book
Watch a lecture by Shor.

### Summary
QFT is faster than the FFT! We will be showing how to encode signals into a quantum state and then perform a Fourier transform on the state. We will also be going over how to do a reverse QFT!

Shor's algorithm is what truly ignited the QC space. With the promise of easily breaking RSA this makes QCs a serious threat to our current security technologies. Interestingly, Shor's algorithm is not provably faster than any classical algorithm. But... proving that may require the collapse of the P vs. NP problem, so don't hold your breath.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
- Read chapter 7 for Monday and Chapter 11 for Wednesday
