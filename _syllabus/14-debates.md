## For Class

### Reading
- Allington,D., S. Brouillette, and D. Golumbia. 2016. “Neoliberal Tools (and Archives): A Political History of Digital Humanities,” *LA Review of Books*. [[Link](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neoliberal-tools-archives-political-history-digital-humanities/)]. Pessimistic take on digital humanities as the “facilitation of the neoliberal takeover of the university.” Important to be aware of all sides of issues in an emerging discipline.
- Skim at least 5 responses to previous article using links found [here](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2016/05/editors-choice-round-up-of-responses-to-the-la-neoliberal-tools-and-archives/) and [here](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2016/05/editors-choice-a-second-round-up-of-responses-to-the-larb-critique/).
- Choose one additional article from the *LARB* [series](https://lareviewofbooks.org/feature/the-digital-in-the-humanities) on "The Digital in Humanities" for which you can provide a 5-minute summary to the class.
